        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>The Hoot is great, but sometimes they run out of hot food. Sometimes you don't know when they've run out of hot food and you trek all the way over even though it's cold and raining outside because you're hungry goddamnit and you eventually get there and discover the aforementioned lack of hot food and a soda or candy bar is just not going to cut it and you sink silently to the floor as tears stream down your face. When that happens, let your peers know here and save them the trip.</p>
